# Flight-Data-Analysis
Our mini project is about analyzing flight data and querying it accordingly. Flight data
consists of huge amount of data every day. Unlike other transportation platforms, the people
using aircrafts, fly on daily basis and their data is quite private and extractable. Using Big Data
analytics it is easy to fetch the data and perform necessary operations on it.
In Aircraft, there are approximately millions of monthly active travelers. Aircraft
travelling allows the people to constantly make business travels, family tours, pilgrimage visit
etc.
In our project we will calculate the delays of the flights and also the customer feedback
based on that delays and the passenger willing to travel again or not based on their feedback
on these delays.
In our project we identify the flight data which is nothing but the characterized data of the
travelers, which is actually private but can be easily extracted. The feedback of the passengers
could be positive or negative or even neutral.
We fetch the positive feedbacks and query them accordingly. Similarly we fetch the negative
feedbacks and query them according to the userâ€™s requirement.
